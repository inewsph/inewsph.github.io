<br />
It was takbiran night. It was also my birthday, and nothing happened. Or I had thought nothing would happen, but I was wrong.

  

             

That
  night, I was watching television with my family when I heard someone  
lit fireworks in my front yard. I peeped trough my window glass but  
could see nothing. It was very dark outside. Then I thought it had to be
  my cousins who lit the fireworks. Then I plopped down on my sofa again
  and tried to concentrate on the television since my mind raced with  
disappointment that no one gave something special on my birthday. I  
shrugged, it was almost the end of the day and I became pessimist. Five 
 minutes later my mobile beeped. It was a text from my friend asking me 
 to come out. Wondering what was going on, I grabbed my jacket and  
hurried to the front door. I was surprised to see her bring a bag full  
of firework and fire drills. Next I was surprised to see my other friend
  come out from the darkness. She brought a beautiful birthday cake on  
her hands. Oh my God! I shrieked. Then they gave the cake to me who was 
 too stunned to say anything. I realized I was blushing furiously 
because  my whole family was watching. Not to mention my neighbors too!

             

A
  plain day, or I thought it was before, turned out to be one of the  
greatest moment in my life. I didn’t even know how to describe what I  
felt. Happy was the simplest word. <br /><br /><br />

                        Sunday The Terrible<br />Last week was a terrible day for me. My cousin and I were playing 
football in front of the house to spend time with us. First, it was 
really fun until I kicked the ball too strong, so the ball led me to the
 window and broke the window. When we want to escape, all of a sudden we
 all heard a loud voice.<br />  <br />   After that, the owner of the house 
came out of the fence, he yelled at us. We are very afraid of her, but 
we do not know what to do. Then, one of my cousins told us to run, we 
all ran, and suddenly we heard the sound of skin. Then we know that 
homeowners allow dogs to chase us. And we were struggling to run as fast
 as her as we can. But, I fell down so the dog managed to capture me and
 bit my leg. It really hurts me. Then the dog ran back into the house. <br /><br />  
 My cousin took me to the doctor and told my parents. In the end, the 
doctor said that I was exposed to rabies. Then I was hospitalized for 
one week more. That's a terrible day of the week for me, may not happen 
to me again in his next week Sunday.<br /><br />     Yesterday, it was monday. I didn't go to school because it was holiday. At 9 am, i woke up. Then i took a bath. After that i played fb. Before played fb, i had breakfast. I ate bread and drank milk tea. I watched tv at 10 am to 02.10 pm.<br />      I was really sleepy so, i took a nap. Then i took a bath because i, my little brother and my mom went to around Bontang. I arrived at home, at 5 pm. I had dinner and studied because tomorrow i go to school again. At 10 pm, I slept.<br />

                        R.A. Kartini

<br />

Every April 21 people in indonesia 
commemorate the kartini day. It is beautiful day for the woman because 
we celebrate the birth of great lady R.A. Kartini. Everyone knows who 
Kartini is. She is our national heroine and a great lady with the bright
 idea.



Kartini was born in 1879 April 21 in 
mayong jepara. Her father was Rama Sosroningrat a Wedana (assistant of 
head of regency) in mayong. Her mother, Ma Ngasirah was a girl from 
Teluk Awur village in Jepara as the daughter of a noble family, she felt
 luck because she got more than the ordinary people got. She got better 
education than other children. In november 12 1903 she married adipati 
djoyodiningrat, the head of rembang regency. According to javanese 
tradition Kartini had to follow her husband. Then she moved to rembang.<br />
 

In September 13 1904 she gave a birth to
 her son. His name was Singgih. But after giving birth to a son, her 
condition was getting worse and she finally passed away on september 17 
1904 on her 25 years old.

<br />

Now Kartini has gone. but her spirit and
 dream will always be in our heart. Nowadays Indonesian women progress 
is influenced by kartini's spirit stated on collection of letter "habis 
gelap terbitlah terang" or  from the dusk to the dawn.<br /><br /><br />R.A. Kartini<br /><br /><br />Setiap 21 April masyarakat di Indonesia 
memperingati hari kartini. Ini adalah hari yang indah untuk wanita 
karena kita merayakan kelahiran wanita hebat R.A. Kartini. Semua orang 
tahu siapa Kartini. Dia adalah pahlawan nasional kami dan seorang wanita
 hebat dengan ide cemerlang.<br /><br />Kartini lahir pada tahun 1879 21 
April di Mayong Jepara. Ayahnya adalah Rama Sosroningrat seorang Wedana 
(asisten Bupati) di Mayong. Ibunya, Ma Ngasirah adalah seorang gadis 
dari desa Teluk Awur di Jepara yang merupakan putri dari keluarga 
bangsawan, dia merasa beruntung karena dia mendapat lebih dari pada 
orang biasa. Dia mendapat pendidikan yang lebih baik daripada anak-anak 
lain. Pada tanggal 12 November 1903 ia menikah dengan adipati 
djoyodiningrat, kepala Kabupaten Rembang. Menurut tradisi Jawa Kartini 
harus mengikuti suaminya. Kemudian ia pindah ke Rembang.<br /><br />Pada 13 
September 1904 ia melahirkan anaknya. Namanya Singgih. Tapi setelah 
melahirkan seorang putra, kondisinya semakin parah dan dia akhirnya 
meninggal dunia pada 17 September 1904 berusia 25 tahun.<br /><br />Sekarang
 Kartini telah tiada. Tapi semangat dan mimpi nya akan selalu berada di 
hati kita. Saat ini kemajuan perempuan Indonesia dipengaruhi oleh 
semangat kartini yang diyatakan dalam koleksi surat "Habis Gelap 
terbitlah Terang" yang ditulisnya<br /><br />

My Adventure at Leang-Leang Cave Leang-leang Cave at Maros, South Sulawesi, Indonesia
On Sunday, my parents, my best friend Sam and I visited a cave at
 Maros called Leang-leang . It was my first time to visit the cave, 
better yet, my best friend came to visit it with me!
The cave was famous for its primitive cave wall paintings which 
were some hand prints and wild boar paintings. The cave and its 
surroundings was turned into a national park, so it was taken care of.
My parents took a rest in a small hut for visitors of the park, 
while Sam and I adventured around the cave with a guide. We had to climb
 some metal stairs to get to the cave, because the cave was embedded 
into a small mountain.<br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:My First Time in Yogyakarta
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>My family and I went to my grandmother’s house in Yogyakarta last month. It was my first trip to this city. We went there two days after my sister’s gradution ceremony in Semarang. We arrived at Yogyakarta at night. We spent a week staying in my grandmother’s house which is 5 minutes away by foot to Malioboro street.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In the first morning, we were still too tired after a long trip from Semarang to Yogyakarta. So we decided to stay at home to recharge our energy. I walk around the neighborhood with my sister just to experience how it is like to be in Yogyakarta. There were too many house, I think, which made the space between a house and the other was so small, even the road was also small that only bicycle and motorcycle can go through.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>On the second day, all of us went to Malioboro street. We saw so many merchant with various of product which they claim to be a traditional product of Yogyakarta. I bought some wooden figurine and T-shirt with the word “Yogyakarta” printed on it, while my sister bought some leather handbag. My mom and dad were busy choosing some merchandise to be brought home when we go back.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>On the third day, we went to Taman Sari and Keraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat to see some historical building in Yogyakarta. We took a lot of picture there. We also took some picture of the building so we can check it again at home. We found some place providing Yogya traditional food around the building and we jumped in right away.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>We spent the rest of our week in Yogyakarta by visiting some Shopping Malls such as Jogja City Mall, Malioboro Mall, Hartono Mall and Ambarrukmo Plaza. We realized that Yogyakarta turned out to be very warm during the day, that was the reason why we decided to spend more time in air conditioned building like this.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        IMAGINATIVE RECOUNT<br /><br /><br />Written as Ned Kelly’s mother:<br />Today was a busy day. Luckily Kate was home to help me wash sheets, make quince jam and look after our newest member, the baby. Today was just like any other normal day.  We had just finished doing our chores when Dan came in and started eating the dinner we had just cooked.  Kate was feeding the baby.<br />There was a loud knock at the door.  I sat there and watched if Dan or Kate would move.  Dan suddenly got out of his seat still holding his knife and fork.  He yelled, “Can’t a man eat in peace?”<br />When Dan answered the door, I heard a deep voice say, “I’ve come to arrest you Mr Dan Kelly for horse stealing.”  I watched Dan eat up his last bit of dinner.  He then told me that he was getting arrested.  I told him he didn’t have to go if there wasn’t a warrant.  I yelled at him and told him that he shouldn’t have let him in.<br />Dan firmly said, “It’s okay Mum,” trying to calm me down.  I took out the bread from the oven.  Dan took a massive piece of thick bread and ate the last piece of food from his bowl.<br />Constable Fitzpatrick stood there.  Dan said, ‘I will just go get my jacket!” I followed Dan yelling at him that he shouldn’t have let him in.  I could hear Kate screaming.  I rushed back to see what was going on.  She explained that Fitzpatrick was harassing her.  I stormed into the kitchen, got the shovel and hit him across the head.<br />Dan raced back in and held him to the ground.  Soon after the door flung open with Ned standing there.  Ned came in and took Fitzpatrick’s gun.  The revolver went off and got Fitzpatrick in the wrist.  Both boys stood there and said, “Touch our sister again and there will be a bullet to your head.”<br />I was proud of my sons for standing up for their sister.<br />

This is my experience in middle school, exactly 3 years ago when I was in 7th grade. Every year, our school held scout activities which must be followed by all 7th grade students and at the end of each semester there were camp activities held at the school.
</p><p>When the D-day arrived, before the activity began the opening ceremony was held to get information and direction during the camp activities. After that, my team mate and I immediately set up a tent that was assisted by a coach. After the tent was established, we immediately arranged the equipment we had brought. Shortly, the whistle rang, I quickly put on a tie and other scout gear because there would be a game between teams to train the cohesiveness and togetherness of each team. Then there was heavy rain. Considering that all the equipment was in the tent, the school finally decided that all students would take refuge in the hall, let the conditions where it was not possible to come in because there were several tents which had collapsed by the wind, and the field were very muddy. Arriving at the hall, we immediately rushed to the bathroom to change our clothes.  </p><p>After each team gathered according to each class, everyone got a box of rice which could be enjoyed together. After dinner, the rain stopped. We went straight to the courtyard to enjoy the campfire and watch the performances of each team, in the form of songs and poems. After the campfire event was over, the school announced that the female students in that night must sleep in the meeting room, while the men remained in the hall. Finally we were moved again. In our hearts, we were very happy because of the meeting room has an air conditioner, and it might not be fair for men to have to sleep without air conditioner.
</p><p>The next morning at around 5 a.m, all students had to get up and get ready, because morning exercise would be held. After that, we enjoyed the breakfast together. We didn't forget to clear the tent that had collapsed and saved it again. Around 8 o'clock, we prepared for the closing ceremony. This was an unforgettable experience.

                         My Best Friend, Haruka In Senior high school, I had best friend from Korea. Her name was Haruka. She was beautiful, smart, and low profile. For that many people loved her, included of me myself. It was because, even though she was from foreign country that considered by many students would be arrogant with students in my school, but Haruka was different. She was a good girl. I and Haruka became good friend each other. I was really glad in having friend like her. It was because even though she was from rich family and I was not from rich family. She wanted to have a friend like me. She wanted to share everything to me. So, did I. For the example, when she had something, like knowledge, foods, or even gift, she would give to me. Then, I did the same thing like her, for the example if my mom made a food, traditional food, I would give that food also to Haruka. One day, I was invited by Haruka’s family to attend Haruka’s birth day. I came to Haruka’s house as shown in invitation card. I was very surprised when I looked the house of Haruka that was very luxurious, and beautiful. I felt afraid to enter Haruka’s house. For that, I only waited on the outside of Haruka’s house. I stood at fence. Then, seven minutes, I stood at fence.  I saw Haruka went to out from her house. She came to me and she asked why I did not enter. I did not answer, I only smiled. Then, she said to me that her birthday would not be started without the existence of me. I was very touched in hearing that. I hugged her. Then, I and Haruka entered to Haruka’s house.  Many guests looked at me and Haruka. Then, the party started. Before that, Haruka’s parents introduced me to the guests that I was the best friend for her daughter and Haruka’s family wanted me follow them to holiday in Korea next month. Many people gave applause to me and Haruka’s family. I was so touched. I felt to cry. I was fortunate having friend like Haruka, and knew Haruka’s family.<br />

                        A Day Visit to Surabaya<br />Last week, I went to Surabaya with my family. My father drove the car. My mother sat beside him. My sister and I sat in the back seats.<br />We woke up early in the morning. My father prepared the car in the garage while mother was preparing food for breakfast and some snacks for us. My sister and I packed some clothes. After everything got ready and we had our breakfast, we left the house at six o'clock. <br />It was about nine A.M. We arrived at Surabaya. First of all we visited our uncle. We stayed there for an hour and a half. Then we went to a beach. We got there at eleven o'clock. There were a lot of tourists because it was holiday. I saw many foreign visitors too. My parents watched us playing with sand in the beach. We did not swim and take a bath since the wave was rough. After having lunch, we went on our picnic to the museum and shopping centre.<br />We drove back to our house at 7 o'clock and arrived home at ten. We were tired but happy.<br />

                        A Sad
Story of 5 Serangkai

When I am sitting under mango tree alone, I remembered
about my good friends a long time ago. They were Tuti, Pipit, Nurul, and Siska.
At the time, we were really quite loyal friends. It could be known from what we
had done every day. We were always went to school; came back home; played; and
studied together.  Even though we were not in the same class, but we were
so close each other. It made many friends in the school called us as “5
Serangkai”.

One day, after we came home at 01.00 PM o’clock. We
planned to study together in Tuti’s home, more precisely, under Tuti’s mango
tree which was very quiet and cooler. At that time, all the members of 5
Serangkai had completed. Pipit, Nurul, Siska, and I came on time. We would never
be late, except there was an obstacle that disturbed us. At 01.45, we started
to study with discussing about the answers of our homework.

But, when we hadn’t finished it yet, something
happened to Tuti. She suddenly fell to the ground from the bench that she sat.
We, her friends, were very shocked about it. Then, we all tried to make Tuti
became conscious by giving the first aid. We shouted and called Tuti’s parents.
Soon after that, Tuti was hospitalized and tomorrow morning, all of us were so
sad. We heard the news that Tuti died. Seven years ago, she had passed away.

                        My sister and I went to see a film last night. It was an American movie called The Lost Flight. It showed how people can quickly change when they have to look after themselves in the jungle. It was an interesting film about a plane which crashed on a small empty island in the Pacific Ocean.<br />Although the passengers were safe, nobody knew where the plane had crashed. So the passengers had to learn how to hunt for food in the jungle and how to catch fish from the sea to eat. After a few weeks, the passengers were eating raw fish and meat.<br />After they had been on the island for two months, three of the men made a boat and sailed away to find help. But their boat sank and they were drowned.<br />The film ended without saying whether the passengers were rescued or not. But my sister and I enjoyed the film. Semoga di jadikan jawaban yg benarBeing Late<br /><br />Last morning, Dinar, my roommate woke up late and she had to go to campus. <br /><br />When she wanted to take her motorcycle, in fact she couldn’t move it because there were some motorcycles that blocked up her motorcycle. She tried to move all of the motorcycles, so that her motorcycle could move from the garage. But she couldn’t do it. Then, she called Adel who had that motorcycle which blocked it up. After that, her friend who had that motorcycle helped her. Finally, she could move her motorcycle and rode it to go to campus.<br /><br />
