She had always been afraid of heights, but something about this moment made her feel alive. She closed her eyes and breathed in the salty air, feeling a sense of peace wash over her.It was a dark and stormy night, and Jenny was driving home from work when she saw a figure walking along the side of the road. As she got closer, she realized it was a man, drenched from head to toe. Without thinking, she pulled over and offered him a ride. The man climbed into her car, and as they drove off, Jenny couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about him.When Alex woke up that morning, she knew something was different. Her body felt lighter, and she had a sense of clarity she had never experienced before. As she went about her day, she noticed that everything seemed to fall into place effortlessly, and she felt like she was exactly where she was meant to be. It was only later that night, when she looked up at the sky and saw a shooting star, that she realized she had been given a gift.John had always been an adventurous soul, so when he saw an ad for a one-way ticket to Mars, he knew he had to go.

Even before the plane landed, the little windows in the airplane revealed snow and ice-covered houses and buildings. As I walked off the plane, cold air crept though the corrugated ramp that led to the airport terminal. Some people inside the airport were wearing big coats and hats, which I had seen on television, but never up close. I felt a little dizzy and needed to sit down, and then my cell phone rang. It was my Aunt Sophia. She was waiting for me outside in the passenger pick-up area, so I walked quickly to the exit, forgetting all about my luggage. When the sliding glass door opened to the outside, there was my aunt--a woman I hadn't seen in over ten years--wearing a parka and waving her arms frantically in my direction.</p><p></p><p>semoga membantu</p><br />

                        True Friends<br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />Moral of the Story- A true friend in need is a friend indeed.<br />The Mouse Deer And The Tiger (cerita kancil dan harimau)<br />

Once there was a farmer from Laos. Every morning and every evening, he ploughed his field with his buffalo.

<br />

One day, a tiger saw the farmer and his 
buffalo working in the field. The tiger was very surprised to see a big 
animal listening to a small animal. The tiger wanted to know more about 
the big animal and the small animal.

<br /> 



After the man went home,
 the tiger spoke to the buffalo; “you are so big and strong. Why do you 
do everything the man tells you?” The buffalo answered; “oh, the man is 
very intelligent”.

<br />

The tiger asked; “can you tell me how intelligent he is?”. “No, I can’t tell you”, said the buffalo; “but you can ask him”

<br />

So the next day the tiger asked to the 
man; “Can I see your intelligence?”. But the man answered; “it at home”.
 “Can you go and get it?” asked the tiger. “Yes” said the man; “but I am
 afraid you will kill my buffalo when I am gone. Can I tie you to a 
tree?”

After the man tied the tiger to the 
tree, he didn’t go home to get his intelligence. He took his plough and 
hit the tiger. Then he said; “Now you know about my intelligence even 
you haven’t seen it.

little girl rubbed another match into the wall,when the flame was on,she saw a
table and delecious food on it.The little girl saw a delecious roast goose on
the table,when the little girl start to ate the roast goose,the flame went out
,and the roast goose was disappeared .

                 <br />                   She lighted another match. Now she was
sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree,it was still larger, and more
decorated than the one which she had seen through the window of someone house
before.

              <br />                         Thousands
of lights were burning from the Christmas tree,the little girl stretched out
her hands towards them .When the match went out,the lights of the Christmas
tree rose higher and higher, she saw them now as stars. one of them fell down
as a shooting star. she then remembers her dead grandmother saying that such a
falling star means someone is dying and is going to heaven.

               <br />                            The little
girl rubbed another match into the wall,when the flame was on she saw her
grandmother. “grandmother, take me with you! You go away when the match burns
out; you vanish like the warm stove, like the delicious roast goose, and like
the magnificent Christmas tree!" And she rubbed the whole bundle of
matches quickly against the wall,to keep her grandmother near her.

                And the
matches gave such a brilliant light that it was really bright.And than her
grandmother took the little girl on her arm,and both of them flew  in brightness and in joy.They flew so high to
the place that they never feel hungry,or cold anymore.

                <br />                 But in
a corner formed by two houses , sat the little poor girl, with rosy cheeks and
with a smiling mouth.She was frozen to death.But, with her grandmother she had
entered on the joys of a new year

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Stay connected: Talking with loved ones while in isolation can help reduce the anxiety and instances of feeling down. Take time to utilize the multitudes of technologies and apps (many free) that can help you stay in touch with those you love. Our busy lives before the COVID-19 may have limited how often we connected with distant loved ones, now’s the time to fully exploit these modern capabilities for fellowship, companionship, and camaraderie.</p><p></p><p>Self-care: Take time to take care of yourself. Be supportive and suggest the same for those close to you. Meditation, relaxation, quality time with family, personal care of yourself promotes overall wellness. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) has free, evidence-based, self-care tools developed</p><p></p><p>Stay active: The gyms may not be open, however, there are lots of safe alternatives to getting physical activity without going against the preventive best practices recommended by the CDC like social distancing and avoiding large crowds. Aerobics can be done successfully at home. Another important point to consider is that avoiding crowds does not mean avoiding nature. Going for a brisk walk or jog outside in uncrowded areas outdoors is still considered relatively safe.  Push-ups, sit-ups, jumping-jacks and more exercises are great ways to stay fit away from the gym.</p><br />

                Little Mantu lived in a village deep in the 
jungle,where elephants helped the men work.They could lift up the 
heaviest logs.then , Mantu had an elephant of his very own. Hisname was 
Opie. He was just a baby and Mantu loved<br />him very much. Mantu whispered to Opie’s ear that<br />someday he would become the biggest, strongest and<br />bravest elephant in the jungle. The other elephants<br />heard this. They began to laugh and made rude noises<br />with their trunks. “We’re so big and tall, but you’re<br />so small. You’re nothing at all,” said one of the big<br />elephants.<br />Mantu looked up at the huge elephant with a<br />mishievous glint in his eye. “You’re so tall and can<br />see far away. We can see what is happening down<br />here in the jungle. In fact, we would be the worst to see<br />any slithering snakes that may be a danger. “After<br />hearing the word snakes, the elephants screeched<br />and off they gwents thundering in fright.<br />“Did I say there were snakes?” giggled Mantu. “No,<br />I don’t think so,” smiled Opie. Mantu then climbed upon<br />his little friend’s back and went home to the village to tell<br />everyone about the foolish elephants.<br />
            <br />                                Queen of Arabia and Three Sheiks

<br />

<br />Maura, who like to be thought of as the 
most beautiful and powerful queen of Arabia, had many suitors. One by 
one she discarded them, until her list was reduced to just three sheiks.
 The three sheiks were all equally young and handsome. They were also 
rich and strong. It was very hard to decide who would be the best of 
them.

<br /> 



One evening, Maura disguised herself and
 went to the camp of the three sheiks. As they were about to have 
dinner, Maura asked them for something to eat. The first gave her some 
left over food. The second Sheik gave her some unappetizing camel’s 
tail. The third sheik, who was called Hakim, offered her some of the 
most tender and tasty meat. After dinner, the disguised queen left the 
sheik’s camp.

<br />

The following day, the queen invited the
 three sheiks to dinner at her palace. She ordered her servant to give 
each one exactly what they had given her the evening before. Hakim, who 
received a plate of delicious meat, refused to eat it if the other two 
sheiks could not share it with him.

<br />

This Sheik Hakim’s act finally convinced
 Queen Maura that he was the man for her. “Without question, Hakim is 
the most generous of you” she announced her choice to the sheiks. “So it
 is Hakim I will marry”.

                        <p>My Shit Day
</p><p>
</p><p>          When I woke up on Monday, I was very surprised to see that the clock was 6:30. I immediately got up and took a quick shower. After taking a shower, I ate breakfast, then left for school on public transportation. When I got off the angkot, I opened the bag to take money. Immediately I remembered that today was Monday. The time for the flag ceremony was held. Apparently I forgot to put a hat in the bag. Finally with confidence, I walked to school.
</p><p>
</p><p>          Arriving at school, it turned out that the students had gathered in the field. The ceremony almost begins. I also rushed to the ceremony field and the back of the ceremony. When the ceremony began, the principal immediately gave a briefing on the school rules. Suddenly a teacher came to check the neatness of his students. And unfortunately, I don't wear a hat. Me and my friends who violate the rules must line up separately with students who do not violate the rules.
</p><p>
</p><p>          After the ceremony was over, children who violated the rules of conduct could not leave the field. Because it will be punished. We were told to clean the ceremony field. One of my teachers watched us. Half an hour passed, suddenly my teacher called us to line up again. It turned out that the penalty for clearing the field had been completed. We feel relieved. I thought this sentence was over. But our teacher added us more punishment. We were told to write "I will not repeat this action again" to 100x. And it must be finished at the first break. How surprised I was after hearing those words. Inwardly saying that only because of a school hat, I was punished like this.
</p><p>
</p><p>          Luckily, the first lesson was empty because the teacher did not enter. I used it to write the sentence given by the teacher. My job is complete right at break time. Q collected it with friends. I feel relieved. From that experience, I always bring my hat into the bag.
</p><br /><br />

One evening, some fishermen passed by the pond and saw the fish. “This pond is full of fish”, they told each other excitedly. “we have never fished here before. We must come back tomorrow morning with our nets and catch these fish!” So saying, the fishermen left. When the eldest of the three fish heard this, he was troubled. He called the other fish together and said, “Did you hear what the fishermen said? We must leave this pond now. The fishermen will return tomorrow and kill us all!” The second of the three fish agreed. “You are right”, he said. “We must leave this pond now.” But the youngest fish laughed. “You are worrying without reason”, he said. “We have lived in this pond all our lives, and no fisherman has ever come here. Why should these men return? I am not going anywhere – my luck will keep me safe”. The eldest of the fish left the pond that very evening with his entire family. The second fish saw the fishermen coming in the distance early next morning and left the pond at once with all his family. The third fish refused to leave even then. The fishermen arrived and caught all the fish left in the pond. The third fish‟s luck did not help him – he was caught and killed.<br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p>Malin Kundang<p>Once upon a time, on the north coast of Sumatera lived a poor woman and his son, who called Malin Kundang. His Father eventually died, and his mother lived alone as a poverty-stricken old woman.</p><p></p><p>Malin Kundang grew up as a skillful young boy. He always helps his mother to earn some money. One day, Malin Kundang decide going to overseas and promise to come back.</p><p></p><p>After several years had gone by, Malin Kudang finally decide to return to his village. He arrived wearing fine clothes and traveling on one of his ships. Someone arriving in such splendor was uncommon to the villagers, so many of them went down to the harbor to view the sight.</p><p></p><p>One of the villagers recognized Malin Kundang form a scar that he had received while playing as a child. Upon recognizing the mark, the villager went to tell Malin Kundang's mother that her son had returned. Excitedly, she went to the shore and recognized her son the minute her eyes fell on him.</p><p></p><p>When the older woman called him her son, he refused to believe that he head such an old woman as a mother. His disbelief was heightened when his wife questioned why he had not told her that he had an elderly, poor mother.</p><p></p><p>In an alternate translation, Malin Kundang was on the ship with just his crew. When his mother attempted to embrace him, he was too embarrassed by her ragged appearance to acknowledge her and instead, had one of them carry her away.</p><p></p><p>Distraught and finally realizing he son's wickedness, Malin Kundang's mother gave up on her son's acknowledging her and prayed to her god to punish her son for his behavior.</p><p></p><p>The day after his mother's prayer, Malin Kudang sailed out of the village. Shortly thereafter, the ships was met by a violent storm. Malin Kundang believed the storm was his god's and nature's ways of punishing him for his mistreatment of his mother.</p><p></p><p>He felt guilty about his behavior towards her, asked for forgiveness, and began to pray. However, his repentance was too late, for the ship was destroyed at sea. But, in some translations of the tale, Malin Kundang was turned into coral. In other, the ship, the crew, and he become rock formations that are still standing.</p><p></p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>semoga membantu✌</p><br />
