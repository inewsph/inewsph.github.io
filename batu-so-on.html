We headed from Kediri at 4nd finally got there at 8. We were so hungry when we got to Batu, so we decided to buy some breakfastnear the Jatim Park.At half-past 9, we entered the park for the first time. I was so amazed by the park's architecture. There areso many rides and game centers inside it. So far, Ghost Hospital ride was the best one I'd ever through.At 12.30 PM, we gathered to have lunch and Dzuhur pray. Afterward, I accompanied my sister to play somerides and buy souvenirs. We finished our trip by 4 o'clock and went back to Kedin.OA It was the second times the writer went to Jatim ParkB. the writer had breakfast in Batu, MalangOC. the writer entered the Park at 8 A.M.O D. the writer went to Jatim Park by bus​bantu jawab ya kak, ❤</a>

                                            I just returned from my holiday in my uncle’s house in Malang. During the time, I visited many interesting places, such as Jatim Park 1 and 2, Museum Angkut, Batu Night Spectacular and Mount Bromo. However, the most memorable is my trip to Mount Bromo. It is the most exotic place I’ve ever seen.
At that time I went with my uncle’s family. We went there by car in middle of night and arrived at around 3:30 a.m. There were already many people there. They all wore thick jackets, gloves and beanies, so did we. It was so cold that we were going to freeze. Soon, we could adapt to the weather.
Later on we moved to Penanjakan Peak to see the sunrise. Later on we withnessed such a magnificent sunrise. Luckily, the weather was so fine that we all could see that shinning golden ball very clearly. Then, we walked up to the top of Mount Bromo. It was really hard because we had to walk through thick sand desert while it was rather cold. Arriving at the top, it was so amazing! Trush me, you should go there one day. What a wonderful place!
Overall my last holiday is the best moment of my life. I wish I have another chance to explore Malang City.

                                            A long time ago, the sea near West Java Province was ruled by a beautiful queen. She was not only beautiful but also caring. Every day, the queen went around the sea to check her sea creatures. One day, being tired, the queen sat on a big rock at the bottom of the sea. Then a thin bull shark came by and offered to take her to the palace. So the queen sat on the shark's back while the shark swam through the ocean. The queen was so impressed by the shark's agility and strong body. She asked the shark to be her guardian. From then on, the shark followed everywhere the queen went. He was even given a personal cave to rest in. However, gradually the shark became arrogant. He even ordered smaller fish to serve him. He became big and fat, day by day, till he could not move fast anymore. He spent his time in his cave all day, sleeping and eating. The queen heard about it, and said angrily, "You don't like moving recently. You are no better than a stone!" One day, when the shark was out of his cave for some fresh air, some fishermen accidently caught him in their net. They pulled and pulled at the net, but it was so heavy. They said, "What have we caught? Why is it so heavy? It might be a massive stone." So they let the shark go The shark slowly sank to the bottom of the sea. He stayed still and gradually his body turnec into a stone, just as the queen had said. People say that the stone at the Batu Hiu Beach in West Java used to be the shark. 1. What is the text about? Answer: What does the first paragraph tell the readers about? Answer: It might be a massive stone. (paragraph 4) What does the underlined word mean? Answer: We can conclude that "The shark became fat he was reluctant to move." What conjunction can complete the sentence? Answer: Why did the fishermen let the shark go? Answer:​</a>

Inaq Lembain got the power and said to her children, "Dear, I am so sorry because I have Ignored you. Now,I will save you".8). Inaq Lembain wagged her girdle to the stone.

Suddenly, two birds were flying near Inaq Lembain and said, "Mom we are you children and we have changed into birds".​</a>

                                            BIG POINTI just returned from my holiday in my uncle’s house in Malang. During the time, i visited many interesting places, such as Jatim Park 1 and 2, Museum Angkut, Batu Night Spectacular and Mount Bromo. However, the most memorable is my trip to mount Bromo. It is the most exotic place i’ve ever seen. At that time i went with my uncle’s family. We went there by car in middle of night and arrived at around 3:30 a.m. There were already many people there. They all wore thick jackets, gloves and beanies, so did we. It was so cold that we were going to freeze. Soon, we could adapt to the weather. Later on we moved to Penanjakan Peak to see the sunrise. Later on we witnessed such a magnificent sunrise. Luckily, the weather was so fine that we all could see that shinning golden ball very clearly. Then, we walked up to the top of Mount Bromo. It was really hard because we had to walk through thick sand desert while it was rather cold. Arriving at the top, it was so amazing! Trush me, you should go there one day. What a wonderful place! Overall my last holiday is the best moment of my life. I wish i have another chance to explore Malang City. TUGAS :Carilah kalimat yang menggunakan PAST TENSE dan PERFECT TENSE!! ​</a>

There lived a family, a father namned Amad Lembain and a mother named Inaq Lembain. They had two children. They were farm workers. One day, Inaq Lembain asked the children to follow her when she worked.1. Inaq Lembain said, "Dear, please sit down on this stone. I will pound the rice." 2. The children said, "Mom, the stone grow taller."3. Inaq Lembain replied, "Please wait. I am still working." 4. Batu Golog became taller and the children screamed, "Mom, please help us." 5. Inaq Lembain didn't see her children and said, "Dear, where are you?" 6. The children replied, "Mom, the stone brought us here. We are on the top of the stone." 7. Inaq Lembain was shocked seeing the stone grew tall over the clouds, then she said to the stone, "Don't bring my children." 8. Inaq Lembain prayed to God, "Give me power to save my children." 9. Inaq Lembain got the power and said to her children, "Dear, I am so sorry because I have ignored you. Now, I will save you." 10. Inaq Lembain wagged her girdle to the stone. The stone was cut into three pieces which quaked the land which was later called Desa Gembong, Dasan Batu, and Montong Teker. Suddenly, two birds were flying near Inaq Lembain and said, "Mom, we are your children and we have changed into birds."​</a>

                            12. I just returned from my holiday in my uncle’s house in Malang. During the time, I visited many interesting places, such as Jatim Park 1 and 2, Museum Angkut, Batu Night Spectacular and Mount Bromo. However, the most memorable is my trip to Mount Bromo. It is the most exotic place I’ve ever seen.
At that time I went with my uncle’s family. We went there by car in middle of night and arrived at around 3:30 a.m. There were already many people there. They all wore thick jackets, gloves and beanies, so did we. It was so cold that we were going to freeze. Soon, we could adapt to the weather.
Later on we moved to Penanjakan Peak to see the sunrise. Later on we withnessed such a magnificent sunrise. Luckily, the weather was so fine that we all could see that shinning golden ball very clearly. Then, we walked up to the top of Mount Bromo. It was really hard because we had to walk through thick sand desert while it was rather cold. Arriving at the top, it was so amazing! Trush me, you should go there one day. What a wonderful place!
Overall my last holiday is the best moment of my life. I wish I have another chance to explore Malang City.

                            14. A long time ago, the sea near West Java Province was ruled by a beautiful queen. She was not only beautiful but also caring. Every day, the queen went around the sea to check her sea creatures. One day, being tired, the queen sat on a big rock at the bottom of the sea. Then a thin bull shark came by and offered to take her to the palace. So the queen sat on the shark's back while the shark swam through the ocean. The queen was so impressed by the shark's agility and strong body. She asked the shark to be her guardian. From then on, the shark followed everywhere the queen went. He was even given a personal cave to rest in. However, gradually the shark became arrogant. He even ordered smaller fish to serve him. He became big and fat, day by day, till he could not move fast anymore. He spent his time in his cave all day, sleeping and eating. The queen heard about it, and said angrily, "You don't like moving recently. You are no better than a stone!" One day, when the shark was out of his cave for some fresh air, some fishermen accidently caught him in their net. They pulled and pulled at the net, but it was so heavy. They said, "What have we caught? Why is it so heavy? It might be a massive stone." So they let the shark go The shark slowly sank to the bottom of the sea. He stayed still and gradually his body turnec into a stone, just as the queen had said. People say that the stone at the Batu Hiu Beach in West Java used to be the shark. 1. What is the text about? Answer: What does the first paragraph tell the readers about? Answer: It might be a massive stone. (paragraph 4) What does the underlined word mean? Answer: We can conclude that "The shark became fat he was reluctant to move." What conjunction can complete the sentence? Answer: Why did the fishermen let the shark go? Answer:​</h2><br />
                        <strong>The text is about a beautiful queen who rules over the sea near West Java Province, who befriends a shark and makes him her guardian, but eventually the shark becomes arrogant and lazy, and is eventually let go by fishermen who mistake him for a stone.</strong><strong>The first paragraph tells the readers about the queen who goes around the sea to check her sea creatures and one day, being tired, sits on a big rock at the bottom of the sea where a thin bull shark offers to take her to the palace.</strong><strong>The underlined word "recently" means that the shark has not been moving much and has become fat and lazy.</strong><strong>The conjunction that can complete the sentence is "because" .</strong><strong>The fishermen let the shark go because they mistook him for a massive stone.</strong><br />

                            26. BIG POINTI just returned from my holiday in my uncle’s house in Malang. During the time, i visited many interesting places, such as Jatim Park 1 and 2, Museum Angkut, Batu Night Spectacular and Mount Bromo. However, the most memorable is my trip to mount Bromo. It is the most exotic place i’ve ever seen. At that time i went with my uncle’s family. We went there by car in middle of night and arrived at around 3:30 a.m. There were already many people there. They all wore thick jackets, gloves and beanies, so did we. It was so cold that we were going to freeze. Soon, we could adapt to the weather. Later on we moved to Penanjakan Peak to see the sunrise. Later on we witnessed such a magnificent sunrise. Luckily, the weather was so fine that we all could see that shinning golden ball very clearly. Then, we walked up to the top of Mount Bromo. It was really hard because we had to walk through thick sand desert while it was rather cold. Arriving at the top, it was so amazing! Trush me, you should go there one day. What a wonderful place! Overall my last holiday is the best moment of my life. I wish i have another chance to explore Malang City. TUGAS :Carilah kalimat yang menggunakan PAST TENSE dan PERFECT TENSE!! ​</h2><br />
