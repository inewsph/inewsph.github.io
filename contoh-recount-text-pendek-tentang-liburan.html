                        my camping experience was awesome. we had a chance to go camping in a small village not far from our school. Last weekends, me and my friends went to the Semeru Mountain, we went to Semeru Mountain by train. After we arrived, We reached the camping ground after we walked about two hours. We  brought some tent and we built it. It was getting colder and darker so we built a fire camp. In the night, We're sang together, play some games, and many.<br /><br />The next day, we just played around and got some pictures of my friends. We took a selfie on the mountain. After we satiesfied with all that we did, we packed our bags and got ready to go home.<br />

                        <p> Watching Movie<br /><br />My sister and I went to see a film last night. It was an American movie called The Lost Flight. It showed how people can quickly change when they have to look after themselves in the jungle. It was an interesting film about a plane which crashed on a small empty island in the Pacific Ocean.<br />Although the passengers were safe, nobody knew where the plane had crashed. So the passengers had to learn how to hunt for food in the jungle and how to catch fish from the sea to eat. After a few weeks, the passengers were eating raw fish and meat.<br />After they had been on the island for two months, three of the men made a boat and sailed away to find help. But their boat sank and they were drowned.<br />The film ended without saying whether the passengers were rescued or not. But my sister and I enjoyed the film.<br /></p><p>Semoga bisa membantu<br /></p><br />

                        Holiday in Bandung<br />My friends and I went to Bandung last month. They were Jezi, Kayla, Gisel, Pevita, and Diandra. We rent a jeep car with a very high cost because we didn’t plan it long before the day. It could be called as unexpected plan. But, it’s okay. We still determined to go by that car.<br />Our first plan was to visit tourism places in Bandung, such as Kawah Putih and Patenggang. However, Kawah Putih was very crowded. So many people visited it. Then we decided to cancel to visit Kawah Putih. Then, we directly went to Situ Patenggang. When we almost arrived there, we could see a very beautiful lake. We were so excited to see it closer. Whtengen we arrived right at our destination, the situation was quite crowded and full of merchants. We immediately came to lake Situ Patenggang. Wow, it was very beautiful. Unfortunately, there were some trashes around the lake. Whether it was lack of management or the visitor who littered was the cause of that condition. I didn’t know. I only hoped that the management officer of this place and all of the visitors could maintain the cleanness of this beauty of nature which has been created by God.<br />

                        GO TO CAMPING<br /><br />Last weekend, my friends and I went camping.<br />We reached the camping ground after we walked for about one and a half hour from the parking lot. We built the camp next to a small river.<br />It was getting darker and colder, so we built a fire camp. The next day, we spent our time observing plantation and insects while the girls were preparing meals. In the afternoon we went to the river and caught some fish for supper.<br />At night, we held a fire camp night. We sang, danced, read poetry, played magic tricks, and even some of us performed a standing comedy.<br />On Monday, we packed our bags and got ready to go home.<br />

(Animals)<br />When we got to the zoo, we went to the shop to buy some food to give to the animals.<br /><br />After getting the food we went to the nocturnal house where we saw birds and reptiles which only come out at night.<br /><br />Before lunch we went for a ride on the elephant. It was a thrill to ride it. Dad nearly fell off when he let go of the rope.<br />During lunch we fed some birds in the park. In the afternoon we saw the animals being fed.<br /><br />When we returned home we were tired but happy because we had so much fun.<br />

I played the white sands, I swam there and i saw some people practiced rock climbing there. Siung beach was in Gunung Kidul, about 2 hours from the center of Jogjakarta. I played for some hours until i felt tired and decided to go back to our car. After that, we went to malioboro to buy some souvenirs. Malioboro was about 30 minutes from Sahid Raya hotel. Malioboro is a busy street, there were many sellers who sold many kinds of souvenirs. Then, we felt hungry, so we went to a Chinese restaurant.

                        Watching Movie<br /><br />My sister and I went to see a film last night. It<br />was an American movie called The Lost Flight. It<br />showed how people can quickly change when they<br />have to look after themselves in the jungle. It<br />was an interesting film about a plane which<br />crashed on a small empty island in the Pacific<br />Ocean.<br />Although the passengers were safe, nobody knew<br />where the plane had crashed. So the passengers<br />had to learn how to hunt for food in the jungle<br />and how to catch fish from the sea to eat.<br />After a few weeks, the passengers were eating<br />raw fish and meat.<br />After they had been on the island for two<br />months, three of the men made a boat and sailed<br />away to find help. But their boat sank and they<br />were drowned.<br />The film ended without saying whether the<br />passengers were rescued or not. But my sister<br />and I enjoyed the film.<br />

                        The start of the rise of the kingdom of Melayu can be dated to 1025 when
 India's Chola kingdom attacked and destroyed the capital of the 
Sumatran maritime empire of Srivijaya.
 This allowed a number of smaller Sumatran polities to expand their 
political and economic influence. During the twelfth and thirteenth 
centuries it seems that from its river estuarine basis along the Batang 
Hari, Melayu became the dominant economic power in Sumatra. The 
substantial archaeological remains at Muaro Jambi suggest that this may 
have been the site of the Melayu capital. The city's age of glory came 
to an end in 1278 when Java's Singhasari
 kingdom attacked the city, even succeeding in capturing members of the 
royal family. The site was rediscovered by Dutch explorers in the 
nineteenth century. It is now protected as a national monument.<br />once upon a time, i took my holiday with my family. we went to jambi together to spent our holiday.

                        <strong>My Vacation in Bali</strong> When I was 3nd grade of junior high school, my friends and I trip to 
Bali for vacation. We were there for five days. We got many precious 
experiences during the vacation.
First day, we visited Kuta Beach in the morning. We saw the lovely 
sunrise there. It was an outstanding view. Then, we checked in to the 
hotel at the night. After taking a nap at the hotel, we went to Tanah 
Lot. Tanah lot was nice place. It was lovely place for taking photo. We 
saw so many tourists there.
 
Second day, we spent our time on Tanjung Benoa beach. We played water
 sports at there. We drove banana boat and speed boat. In the afternoon,
 We went to Penyu island to see unique animals such as big turtles, 
snake, and sea birds. We felt enjoyed and happy.<br />
The last day, we went to Sangeh. We could enjoy the shady forest. There 
were so many monkeys. Sometimes the monkey could be naughty. We could be
 really close with them. After that, we visited to Sukowati Market. I 
bought Bali T-Shirt, souvenirs and some food for gift there
At the night, we had to check out from the our hotel. We went back home and bring so many unforgettable memories of Bali.<br />OrientationMy
 friends and I decided to visit Bali on our school holiday last month. 
There were a lot of places to see in there. Because we never went to 
Bali before, we joined the tours to see as much as possible. My friends 
and I stayed in one of hotel in Kuta on arrival.Sequence of eventsIn
 Kuta beach, we spent our two days by surfing and swimming. Fikri, one 
of my friends tried to sunbathe as if he were a foreigner. We really 
enjoyed our time there. On the next day, we were ready to visit the 
other place listed by the tour guide. the first place we visited was 
SIngaraja. Singaraja is a city of about 95 thousands people. It is a 
busy city but quiet town. The street are lined with trees adn ther are a
 lot of old Dutch houses. We learnt about history of SIngaraja there. 
Then we returned very late to the hotel. We went to bed to regain our 
stamina.<strong>Advertisement</strong> Our
 last tour destination was Ubud. There were a lot of art and craft in 
Ubud. The first stop was at Batu bulan, a center of stone sclupture. We 
watched young boys were carving away at big block of stone. The next 
place we visited was Celuk, a center for silversmiths and goldensmiths. 
After that, we had a lunch at Sukawati and continued touring to Mass, a 
tourist center. We bought some souvenirs in there.Re-orientationOur
 holiday ended very quickly. Beside visiting some places, all our days 
were spent on the beach. We went sailing or surfboarding every day. We 
really enjoyed our holiday in Bali.<br /><br />

Last week my friend and I were bored after three weeks of holidays, so 
we rode our bikes to Pasir Kencana Beach, which is only five kilometres 
from where I live. When we arrived at the beach, we were surprised to 
see there was hardly anyone there.<br /><br />After having a quick dip in 
the ocean, which was really cold, we realized one reason there were not 
many people there. It was also quite windy. After we bought some hot 
chips at the takeaway store nearby, we rode our bikes down the beach for
 a while, on the hard, damp part of the sand. We had the wind behind us 
and, before we knew it, we were many miles down the beach.<br /><br />Before
 we made the long trip back, we decided to paddle our feet in the water 
for a while, and then sit down for a rest. While we were sitting on the 
beach, just chatting, it suddenly dawned on us that all the way back, we
 would be riding into the strong wind.<br /><br />When we finally made it back home, we were both totally exhausted! But we learned some good lessons that day.
