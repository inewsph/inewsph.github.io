                        storytelling of snow white<br />A
 long time ago, a child was born to a queen and king and she was called 
Snow White.  When the queen died, the king married again.  This new 
queen was wicked and hated Snow white.  The queen gave orders that Snow 
White was to be treated as a servant.
                                    Snow White grew very beautiful and one day a Prince riding by, saw her at work and fell in love with her.
                                    The
 queen was beautiful too, and every day she asked her Magic Mirror, "Who
 is the fairest in the land?" and the mirror always answered, "You are 
the fairest one of all".
                                    But
 one day the mirror answered Snow White was the fairest in the land, and
 in a rage the queen gave orders to one of her Huntsmen to take Snow 
White into the woods and kill her.
                                    The
 Huntsman had a kind heart and couldn't do the deed so told her to run 
away.  She fled into the woods where Seven little dwarfs lived.  Their 
house was small and strange.
                                     
                                
                                
                                    
                                    Snow
 White entered the little house and finding it very untidy, started to 
clean up.  Upstairs she found seven little beds.  She was very tired and
 stretching out on one of the beds, was soon asleep.
                                    When
 the Dwarfs came home they were surprised to find Snow White and after 
some argument, decided to let her stay.  She promised to cook and look 
after them.
                                    The
 Queen discovered where Snow White was living and disguising herself as a
 witch, took a poisoned apple and set out for the Dwarfs cottage.  She 
gave Snow White the poisoned apple to eat and as soon as she bit the 
apple, she sank into unconsciousness.
                                    Thinking
 she was dead, the Dwarfs built a glass coffin and put her in it. For 
days she lay in the forest in her glass coffin.  One day, the Prince was
 riding through the forest looking for Snow White and found her.  He 
leaned over and kissed her.  She opened her eyes and sat up with a 
smile. Everyone was happy.  The Prince took Snow White to his palace 
where they were married and lived happily ever after.<br /><br />

                        <p>Topic : Environment<br />Script : Ahmad Manan<br />Grade : SMP/SMA/University</p><p>Assalamu ‘alaikum wr. Wb<br />Good Afternoon,</p><p>Honorable all the juries and the committee of this English speech contest.<br />First of all, let’s thank to Allah SWT who has given us many mercies and blessing so we<br />can join this program without any troubles. Secondly, I would like to introduce myself.<br />My name is ……. I am a student of …..</p><p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, in this occasion I would like to tell you about environment.<br />Environment is everything around us. Environment consists of two main parts which are<br />biotic and a biotic environment. Biotic environment is everything around us which are<br />live, for example plants, animals and human beings. While a biotic environment is<br />everything around us which are not live, for example stone, water, wind, land and etc.<br />We must protect our environment as good as possible because it can influence our live.<br />As we know that Indonesia has many tropical forests and it is a source of nature which<br />can help people live peacefully. So as human being we should preserve the forest.</p><p>There are some efforts which should be done by all people:<br />1. Not cutting down the trees in the forest<br />2. Planting any kinds of trees in the barren area of the forest</p><p>Cutting down the trees in the forest can cause many disasters for human beings. Of<br />course it can cause flood because the rain water can’t be absorbed by the root of plants so<br />the water flows directly to the ground. There are many damage caused by the flood,<br />many people being homeless because of flood, the flood kill many kinds of pet, many<br />factories can’t produce anything, transportation can’t run well because the bridge is<br />broken and so on. How horrified the flood is…!!</p><p>Actually, the disasters above can be minimized if all of human beings can preserve our<br />environment and we must pay more attention to the environment whenever and<br />wherever. We must not throw away rubbish anywhere which can disturb the flowing of<br />the river water. We should plant any kinds of trees in the barren area or in side of the<br />road.</p><p>By doing those simple efforts, it means we have participated in the preservation of our<br />environment.<br />I think that’s all and thank you very much for your attention.<br />Wassalamu ‘alaikum wr. Wb</p><p><br /></p><p>^^</p><br />

                        <p><strong>The Legend of Tangkuban Perahu</strong></p><p></p><p>Once upon a time, in West Java, there lived a wise king who had a beautiful daughter.   Her name was Dayang Sumbi.  She liked weaving very much.  One day, she was weaving a cloth. Suddenly, one of her tool fell to the ground.  She was very tired at the time so she was too lazy to take it.  Then she just shouted outloud.</p><p></p><p>“Anybody there?  Bring me my tool.  I will give you special present.  If you are female,  I will consider you as my sister.  If you are male, I will marry you”</p><p></p><p>Suddenly a male dog named Tumang came.  He brought her falling tool.  Dayang Sumbi was very surprised.  She regretted her words but she could not deny it.  So she had to marry Tumang and leave her father.  Then they lived in a small village.  Several months later they had a son.  His name was Sangkuriang.  He was a handsome and healthy boy. Sangkuriang liked hunting very much.  He often went hunting to the wood using his arrow.  When he went hunting Tumang always with him. </p><p></p><p>One day  Dayang Sumbi wanted to eat deer’s heart.</p><p></p><p>“Sangkuriang, will you hunt for a deer today? I want to eat a deer’s heart so much.” Asked Dayang Sumbi.</p><p></p><p>“Of course, mom. Whatever you want, I will give it for you.” Replied Sangkuriang. “Tumang, where are you? Come on, we have to hunt for a deer.”</p><p></p><p>Then Sangkuriang went to the wood with his arrow and his faithful dog, Tumang.  But after several days in the wood Sangkuriang could not find any deer.  They were all disappeared.  Sangkuriang was exhausted and desperate. </p><p></p><p>“Oh God, where can I find a deer? I don’t want to dissapoint my mom. Oh! I know,”</p><p></p><p>Sangkuriang then called Tumang and  kill him.  He did not know that Tumang was his father.  At home he gave Tumang’s heart to her mother.</p><p></p><p>“Sangkuriang, are you sure it’s a deer’s heart? You can’t lie to me! It is Tumang’s heart, isn’t it? Why did you kill him?” said Dayang Sumbi full of angry. She hit Sangkuriang at his head.  Sangkuriang was wounded.  There was  a scar in his head.    She also repelled her son.   Sangkuriang left her mother in sadness.</p><p></p><p>Many years passed and Sangkuriang became a strong young man.  He wandered  everywhere.     One day he arrived at his own village but he did not realized it.  There he met Dayang Sumbi.  At the time Dayang Sumbi was given an eternal beauty by God, so she stayed young forever.  Both of them did not know each other.  So they fell in love and then they decided to marry.</p><p></p><p>But then Dayang Sumbi recognized a scar on Sangkuriang’s head. </p><p></p><p>“Sangkuriang, why there is a scar on your head?” asked Dayang Sumbi.</p><p></p><p>“Oh, when I was a child, my mom hit me on my head.” Replied him.</p><p></p><p>Dayang Sumbi was very shocked. She knew that Sangkuriang was his son.  It was impossible for them to marry.  She told him but he did not believe her.  Sangkuriang wished that they married soon.  So Dayang Sumbi gave him a very difficult condition. </p><p></p><p>“Sangkuriang, if you want to marry me. I have a condition for you. I want you to build a lake and a big boat in one night. I need them for our honeymoon. Can you do that?”</p><p></p><p>“What! Impossible!. But, it’s okay. For you, I will do it. I can do that!”. Sangkuriang agreed. </p><p></p><p>With the help of genies and spirits, Sangkuriang tried to build them.  By midnight he had finished  the lake by building a dam in Citarum river.  Then he started building the boat.  It was almost dawn when he nearly finished it.  Meanwhile Dayang Sumbi kept watching on them.  She was very worried when she knew this.  So she made lights in the east. </p><p></p><p>“Huh? Troops, stop your work! It’s already dawn. The sun will start to rise. Quickly, go home, go home!” said the chair of the genies. They left Sangkuriang alone. </p><p></p><p>“Sangkuriang, you can’t finish my condition. It’s mean that you can’t marry me. You know?” said Dayang Sumbi.</p><p></p><p>“You cheated! You maked the light, so that my troops go. Because of that, I could not fulfill your condition.” Shouted Sangkuriang.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Sangkuriang was very angry. So he kicked the boat.  Then the boat turned out to be Mount Tangkuban Perahu.  It means boat upside down.  From a distant it looks like a boat upside down.</p><p></p><br />

                        One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool spring of water with a rose in the middle of it, she sat herself down to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell.After a time she threw it up so high that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled along on the ground, until at last it fell down into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. She began to cry, and said, 'Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.'Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said, 'Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?''Alas!' said she, 'what can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.'The frog said, 'I do not want your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep on your bed, I will bring you your ball again.''What nonsense,' thought the princess, 'this silly frog is talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he shall have what he asks.'So she said to the frog, 'Well, if you will bring me my ball, I will do all
Storytelling Pendek The Lonely Landy

One day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted
 to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike.

<br />

“Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too 
sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day.

<br />

“Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, 
Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to 
you,” said Tito the rooster.

<br />

Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the 
river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”

<br />

Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?”

<br />

“Oh, nothing,” Landy replied.

<br />

“Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. 
Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes.

<br />

Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor 
you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and 
helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!”

<br />

“Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend.”

<br />

One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his 
friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to 
mess up the party.

<br />

“I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” 
said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.

<br />

Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save 
yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku
 pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body 
into a ball.

<br />

Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike 
pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t
 chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away.

<br />

“Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and 
her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.<br /><br /><br />semoga membantu :)<br />

The farmer had given them a lot of advice, but they always turned a deaf ear. They disliked advice. The farmer felt very sad about it.<br /><br />The farmer was thinking hard and then he got a good idea. He called all of his sons and ordered them, “Bring me a few sticks.” Then, the farmer tied the sticks into a bundle.<br /><br />“Each of you, break this bundle of sticks said!” said the farmer to his sons.

And they thought that if they could get all that precious metal at once, they would get mighty rich very soon. So the man and his wife decided to kill the bird.<br /><br />However, upon cutting the goose open, they were shocked to find that its innards were like that of any other goose!<br /><br /><br />

                        Snow White<br /><br />Once upon a time, there lived a little girl named “Putri Salju”. She lived with her aunt and uncle because her parents were dead.<br /><br />    One day, she heard her uncle and aunt talking about leaving Snow White in the castle because they both wanted to go to America and they didn’t have enough money to take Snow White. Snow White did not want her uncle and aunt to do this so she decided it would be best if she ran away. The next morning she ran away from home when her aunt and uncle were having breakfast. She ran away into the woods. She was very tired and hungry.<br /><br />    Then, she saw this little cottage. She knocked but no one answered so she went inside and fell asleep. Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs were coming home from work. They went inside. There they found Snow White sleeping. Then, Snow White woke up. She saw the dwarfs. The dwarfs said,”What is your name?” Snow White said, “My name is Snow White”.<br /><br />    The dwarfs said, “If you wish , you may live here with us”. Snow White said, “Oh,could I? Thank you”. Then, Snow White told the dwarfs the whole story and Snow White and the seven dwarfs lived happily ever after.<br />
